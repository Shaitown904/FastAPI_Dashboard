# Project Objectives
In this project I sought out to create a web app that monitors and retives the combined cost of all my running ec2 instances and s3 buckets. I deployed this web app on an ec2 instance that resides in a public facing subnet on a custom VPC.   

# Project Overview/Features
This project involves the use of several technologies such as Terraform for IaC(Infastructure-as-Code). AWS services such as ec2, s3, and VPC. Python libaries such as boto3(AWS SDK), FastAPI, and FastAPI templates such as Jinja2Templates. NGINX for the web app hosting. Lastly, I used Html to build the dashboard template for Jinja2.
